# Python-EmuFrontEnd
Attempts to make an emulator front end  
Naturally the files for the emulators and roms cant be uploaded here  
First attempt was mainly to see if it could work, exploring how to open external applications with python

Next attempt was more modular, used different emulators and semi-automatically found roms in the directory and displayed them in a custom frame that allowed navigation with arrow keys
